# j0rsa/min-ubuntu-dropbox

## DESCRIPTION:
Forked from Ralph Slooten's [Alpine Dropbox](https://github.com/axllent/alpine-dropbox) and ported over to a Minimal Ubuntu base after the latest [Dropbox for Linux](https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux) headless clients started requiring additional dependencies that would likely require further hackery of the original [glibc-enabled](https://hub.docker.com/r/frolvlad/alpine-glibc/) Alpine base.

## EXAMPLE USAGE:
```
docker run -d \
    --name dropbox \
    --net=host \
    -e UID=1000 \
    -e GID=1000 \
    -v <path to Dropbox folder>:/dbox/Dropbox \
    -v <path to config folder>:/dbox/.dropbox \
    --restart=unless-stopped \
    j0rsa/min-ubuntu-dropbox
```

## DOCKER PARAMETERS:
| Default Parameters | Function |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `-e UID=1000`   | UID of Dropbox (current) user. |
| `-e GID=1000`   | GID of Dropbox (current) user. |
| `-v /path/to/dropbox/folder:/dbox/Dropbox` | Path to Dropbox folder on host machine. |
| `-v /path/to/config/folder:/dbox/.dropbox` | Path to persistent Dropbox settings folder on host machine. |


## INITIAL SETUP
At first run, the container will download the latest version of the Dropbox Linux client.

Run `docker logs dropbox -f` after starting the container and wait until you see messages similar to:

```
This computer isn't linked to any Dropbox account...
Please visit https://www.dropbox.com/cli_link_nonce?nonce=(xxxxx-random-nonce-value-xxxxx) to link this device.
```

Open the link in a browser to authorise the client and link the container to your Dropbox.

You should then see in the docker log:
```
This computer is now linked to Dropbox. Welcome *your-name*
```

There is no updater script, so to update the Dropbox client; remove the container and add it again. The persistent config folder will ensure you don't need to relink your account again.

## NOTES:
* Dropbox commands should be run as the `dbox` user:

  ```shell
  docker exec -it -u dbox dropbox dropbox-cli help
  ```

  Any custom configuration that is supported by the [dropbox-cli](https://help.dropbox.com/installs-integrations/desktop/linux-commands#commands) can be modified this way.

* The current Dropbox status can be seen in the docker log. It refreshes every five seconds and only outputs data when there are any changes.

  ```shell
  docker logs dropbox -f
  ```

* Check whether the image still could be used

  ```shell
  docker run -it --rm --name dropbox -v $HOME/Documents/data:/dbox/Dropbox -v $HOME/Documents/config:/dbox/.dropbox j0rsa/min-ubuntu-dropbox
  ```

## Ignore file/dir

  ```
  docker exec -it dropbox attr -s com.dropbox.ignored -V 1 <path/to/file>
  ```
